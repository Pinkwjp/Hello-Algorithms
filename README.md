# Hello-Algorithms

Algorithm problems implemented in Python as a way to practice my python skill and coding techniques (OOP, refactoring and others).

I try to make the main logic of the algorithms evident by using classes to better communicate the context of each problem.
Also, I incorporate type hinting to make the code more explicit and to keep the comments at minimal.
I may add other languages as a way to learn those in the future.
