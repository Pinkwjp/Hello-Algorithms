"""
We have a set of requests {1, 2, . . . , n};  the ith request 
corresponds to an interval of time starting at s(i) and 
finishing at f (i). Weâ€™ll say that a subset of the requests 
is compatible if no two of them overlap in time. 

Our goal is to accept as large a compatible subset as possible. 
Compatible sets of maximum size will be called optimal.
